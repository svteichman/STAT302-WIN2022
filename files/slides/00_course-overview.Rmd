### Bad questions:

* How do you do problem 2?
* Here's my code and it's broken. How do I fix it?
]

.pull-right[
### Good questions:
* Here's a snippet of code I used for problem 2: 
<br/>`formatted code snippet`
<br/>It returned the following error:
<br/>`formatted error message`
<br/>Does anyone know why? I already tried...
* I don't understand the concept from Slide 18 today. Could anyone elaborate on why...

# Discussion Board

.pull-left[
### Bad answers:
* this is sooooo easy, here's my solution
]

.pull-right[
### Good answers:
* This error message occurs because your variable is a string instead of a numeric.
Have you tried checking...
* I think you have a bug in line 3 of the code you posted. You have more left parentheses than right parentheses so the line is incomplete.

.middler[.large[statistics + computing]]


---

# What is statistical computing?

In this class we will discuss some basic computer science concepts, but we will emphasize skills for utilizing computers to aid in data analysis.

--

Advances in computation have enabled advances at every step of the data analysis pipeline:

* Data collection, storage, and sharing
* Exploratory data analysis and visualization
* Statistical inference and prediction
* Simulation 
* Communication and distribution of results
---


# Why R?

R is a programming language designed for statistical analysis.

--

* open-source
* free
* large and active community of developers and users
* great analysis tools
* great visualization tools
--

* great user interface...

---

# Why RStudio?

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) designed to make your life easier. 

--

* Organizes scripts, files, plots, code console, ...
* Highlights syntax
* Helpful interactive graphical interface
* Will make an efficient, reproducible workflow *much* easier
--

* R Markdown integration...

---

# Why R Markdown?

* Combine code, output, and writing
* Self-contained analyses
* Creates HTML, PDF, slides (like these!), webpages, ...
--

* Required for your assignments!

# File Organization Matters

---


Easier to start with best practice rather than fix things later!

.middler[![](images/psyduck.gif)]

---

1. Somewhere on your computer, create the folder `STAT302`
2. Within that folder, create the subfolders `short_labs`<sup>1</sup>, `labs`, `projects`
3. Go to course webpage and Short Labs tab, and download the `.Rmd` file for Short Lab 0 and save it in your `short_labs` folder.

.footnote[[1] or `shortLabs`, `ShortLabs`, `Short_Labs`, ... (just follow the rules for file names!)

[2] or `shortLab1`, `short_lab1`, ...
]

# RStudio Interface

By default...

* *Top left*: Editor pane. Browse and edit scripts and data with tabs
* *Top right*: List of objects in your Environment (recall `ls()`), code History
* *Bottom left*: Console for running R code line-by-line (`>` prompt)
* *Bottom right*: Files, plots, packages, help files

---

# Console


* The quick and easy way to run individual lines of code
* Nothing you do here is saved as part of your workflow!

--
* Useful for debugging, testing code, iterating a plot until you like it ...

---

# Operators

```{r}
# Addition
6 + 3
```

```{r}
# Subtraction
6 - 3
```

```{r}
# Multiplication
6 * 3
```

```{r}
# Division
6 / 3
```


---


# Comparison Operators

```{r}
# Greater than
6 > 3
```

```{r}
# Less than
6 < 3
```

```{r}
# Equal to
6 == 3
6 == 3 + 3
```


---

# Comparison Operators

```{r}
# Not equal to
6 != 3
```

```{r}
6 < 6
# Less than or equal to
6 <= 6
```


---

# Logical Operators

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# and
(6 < 3) & (1 < 3)
```


--


```{r, echo = FALSE}
# and
(6 < 3) & (1 < 3)
```


--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# and
(2 < 3) & (1 < 3)
```


--


```{r, echo = FALSE}
# and
(2 < 3) & (1 < 3)
```


--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# or
(6 < 3) | (1 < 3)
```


--


```{r, echo = FALSE}
# or
(6 < 3) | (1 < 3)
```


--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# a bit harder...
(6 < 3) | (1 < 3) & (6 < 3)
```


--


```{r, echo = FALSE}
# a bit harder...
(6 < 3) | (1 < 3) & (6 < 3)
```


---

# Object Types

```{r}
class(7)
class("7")
is.numeric(7)
is.numeric("7")
```


---

# Object Types

```{r}
is.character(7)
is.character("7")
is.na(7)
is.na(0/0)
```


---

# Object Types

```{r, error = TRUE}
as.character(7)
as.numeric("7")
as.numeric("7") + 3 == 10
"7" + 3 == 10
```




---

# Incomplete Code

What if we start a command, but do not finish it?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
> 5 -
+ 
```

Two options:
  * Press `Esc` to exit and *not* execute the line
  * Complete the command

---

# Editor

* Your workflow should be contained here (**not** your console)
* Primarily used for writing and editing .R scripts
* **Never** manipulate your data in the console. 
Your workflow should always be **reproducible!** and contained in a script in your editor.

--
 
  
  
* Try opening a file now using *File > New File > R Script*, write two lines of simple code
* Click `Run` in the bar above your script. What happens?
* Click on one of the lines of code. Press `Ctrl`/`âŒ˜` + `Enter`. What happens?

--

.center[**Important:** Every part of your R workflow belongs in this window!]

---

# Assigning Variables

```{r}
x <- 7
x
x + 3
x == 7
as.character(x)
y <- 3
x + y
```

---

# Environment

* If you didn't already, define a variable in your R Script and run it
* What happens in your Environment tab?

--
* Type `install.packages("palmerpenguins")` in your Console.
* Now add `library(palmerpenguins)` and `data(penguins)` to your script and run it.
* What happens if you click on this in your Environment tab?
  * Note: We will delve deeper into data later!
  

---

# Workspaces

```{r, error = TRUE}
# List all defined objects
ls()
# Remove an object
rm("x")
ls()
x
```


---
# History

* Click on the History tab to see what it contains. Try searching!

--
* Select a line from your history and click `To Source`. What happens?

--
  * Useful for adding lines that you tested in your Console to your scripts

--


.pushdown[.center[**Summary:** Useful to quickly browse what you have defined in your environment]]

# Files, Plots, Packages, Help

* We will explore this tab more as we get into functions and visualization
* Files is used to browse the files on your computer
  * Useful for opening files/data, moving files you are working with
  * *Use caution!* Changing files here is the same as changing them on your computer. If you delete something, it's gone!
* Plots are used to display plots you create in R
* Help is used to browse help files of functions. You can explore these by preceding a function name with `?`. Try `?sqrt` to see.
* Packages shows all the packages you currently have installed (we will get more into this later!)

# R Markdown
---

Let's try making an R Markdown file:

1. Choose *File > New File > R Markdown...*
2. Make sure *HTML Output* is selected and click OK
3. Save the file in your `STAT302` folder, call it `practiceLab1.Rmd`
4. Click the *Knit HTML* button
  * After it is done, browse to the file location using the `Files` tab. What do you notice?
  * Click *Open in Browser* to view the full HTML

---

## R Markdown Headers

The header of .Rmd files is YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) code

5. Change `title` to "Practice Lab"
6. Change `author` to your name in quotes
7. Change `date` to the today's date in quotes

## R Code within R Markdown

We can also run and execute R code within R Markdown. 
To do so encase your code as follows.


    `r ''````{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
    # Your code goes here!
    ```

You can click the green triangle in the corner to evaluate that code chunk to preview the results without compiling the entire document

---

## Useful Code Chunk Parameters

Parameters go into the opening brackets `{r}` and are separated by commas. Here are some you might find useful (checkout the guide links above for more):

* `echo=FALSE`: Hide R code but keep results

* `eval=FALSE`: Do not execute the R code

* `include=FALSE`: Hides all output (useful to load packages at the beginning of your document)

* `cache=TRUE`: Stores the results of the chunk, and only re-runs if the chunk is changed. Useful for files that take a while to compile

* `fig.height=5, fig.width=5`: modify the dimensions of any plots that are generated in the chunk (units are in inches)

---

## In-Line R Code

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
```

You can also include and execute R code directly in the text of your .Rmd!
For example, say we define a variable
```{r}
x <- 7
```
If I want to reference this variable in text, I can do so directly by writing using ticks and starting with r. So if I type:

    The variable I want to reference is `r inline_expr("x", "md")`.
what will appear is:

The variable I want to reference is `r x`.

---

## In-Line R Code

* This allows you to easily see where your values came from!
* This prevents any typos in translating coding results to text!
* This allows you to modify your analysis without needing to copy and paste updated results into your text!
