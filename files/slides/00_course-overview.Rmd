# Introductions

* What should we call you?
* Why are you taking this class?
* One goal for the school year

---

# Collaboration

* You may discuss problems, approaches, and solutions with your **classmates**.
* You must credit anyone with whom you worked on each assignment.
* All submitted work must be your own; you should not submit code or answers copied from any resource including your classmates.

---

# Piazza Discussion

* Worth up to 2% extra credit on your final grade!
* Substantive and helpful questions and answers

--

.pull-left[
### Bad questions:

* How do you do problem 2?
* Here's my code and it's broken. How do I fix it?
]

.pull-right[
### Good questions:
* Here's a snippet of code I used for problem 2: 
<br/>`formatted code snippet`
<br/>It returned the following error:
<br/>`formatted error message`
<br/>Does anyone know why? I already tried...
* I don't understand the concept from Slide 18 today. Could anyone elaborate on why...

* Substantive and helpful questions and answers

.pull-left[
### Bad answers:
* this is sooooo easy, here's my solution
]

.pull-right[
### Good answers:
* This error message occurs because your variable is a string instead of a numeric.
Have you tried checking...
* I think you have a bug in line 3 of the code you posted. You have more left parentheses than right parentheses so the line is incomplete.

# What is statistical computing?

.middler[.large[statistics + computing]]


---

# What is statistical computing?

In this class we will discuss some basic computer science concepts, but we will emphasize skills for utilizing computers to aid in data analysis.

--

Advances in computation have enabled advances at every step of the data analysis pipeline:

* Data collection, storage, and sharing
* Exploratory data analysis and visualization
* Statistical inference and prediction
* Simulation 
* Communication and distribution of results
---


# Why R?

R is a programming language designed for statistical analysis.

--

* open-source
* free
* large and active community of developers and users
* great analysis tools
* great visualization tools
--

* great user interface...

---

# Why RStudio?

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) designed to make your life easier. 

--

* Organizes scripts, files, plots, code console, ...
* Highlights syntax
* Helpful interactive graphical interface
* Will make an efficient, reproducible workflow *much* easier
--

* R Markdown integration...

---

# Why R Markdown?

* Combine code, output, and writing
* Self-contained analyses
* Creates HTML, PDF, slides (like these!), webpages, ...
--

* Required for your labs!

# RStudio Interface

By default...

* *Top left*: Editor pane. Browse and edit scripts and data with tabs
* *Top right*: List of objects in your Environment (recall `ls()`), code History
* *Bottom left*: Console for running R code line-by-line (`>` prompt)
* *Bottom right*: Files, plots, packages, help files

---

# Editor

* Your workflow should be contained here (**not** your console)
* Primarily used for writing and editing .R scripts

--
 
  
  
* Try opening a file now using *File > New File > R Script*, write two lines of simple code
* Click `Run` in the bar above your script. What happens?
* Click on one of the lines of code. Press `Ctrl`/`âŒ˜` + `Enter`. What happens?

--

.center[**Important:** Every part of your R workflow belongs in this window!]

---
layout: true
# Environment & History

* If you didn't already, define a variable in your R Script and run it
* What happens in your Environment tab?

--
* Type `install.packages("palmerpenguins")` in your Console.
* Now add `library(palmerpenguins)` and `data(penguins)` to your script and run it.
* What happens if you click on this in your Environment tab?
  * Note: We will delve deeper into data later!
  
--
* Remove one of your variables and see what happens.

---

* Click on the History tab to see what it contains. Try searching!

--
* Select a line from your history and click `To Source`. What happens?

--
  * Useful for adding lines that you tested in your Console to your scripts

--

# Console
---

* The quick and easy way to run individual lines of code
* Nothing you do here is saved as part of your workflow!

--
* Useful for debugging, testing code, iterating a plot until you like it ...
* Once you get what you were looking for, add it to your script files!
* **Never** manipulate your data in the console. 
Your workflow should always be **reproducible!**

---

## Incomplete Code

What if we start a command, but do not finish it?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
> 5 -
+ 
```

Two options:
  * Press `Esc` to exit and *not* execute the line
  * Complete the command

---
layout: false

# Files, Plots, Packages, Help

* We will explore this tab more as we get into functions and visualization
* Files is used to browse the files on your computer
  * Useful for opening files/data, moving files you are working with
  * *Use caution!* Changing files here is the same as changing them on your computer. If you delete something, it's gone!
* Plots are used to display plots you create in R
* Help is used to browse help files of functions. You can explore these by preceding a function name with `?`. Try `?sqrt` to see.
* Packages shows all the packages you currently have installed (we will get more into this later!)

# File Organization Matters

---


Easier to start with best practice rather than fix things later!

.middler[![](images/psyduck.gif)]

---

1. Somewhere on your computer, create the folder `STAT302`
2. Within that folder, create the subfolders `short_labs`<sup>1</sup>, `labs`, `projects`
3. Within your Short Labs folder, create a subfolder `short_lab_1`<sup>2</sup>
4. Put your both of short lab files from Monday into that folder
5. Within your Labs folder, create a folder for Lab 1 that follows the filename guide

.footnote[[1] or `shortLabs`, `ShortLabs`, `Short_Labs`, ... (just follow the rules for file names!)

[2] or `shortLab1`, `short_lab1`, ...
]

# R Markdown
---

Let's try making an R Markdown file:

1. Choose *File > New File > R Markdown...*
2. Make sure *HTML Output* is selected and click OK
3. Save the file in your new folder, call it `stat302_Lab1.Rmd`
  * *Hint:* Follow along, because this will become your Lab 1 submission!
4. Click the *Knit HTML* button
  * After it is done, browse to the file location using the `Files` tab. What do you notice?
  * Click *Open in Browser* to view the full HTML

---

## R Markdown Headers

The header of .Rmd files is YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) code

5. Change `title` to "Lab 1"
6. Change `author` to your name in quotes
7. Change `date` to the due date in quotes

--


Congrats! You have a functional .Rmd that will soon be your Lab 1 submissions!

## R Code within R Markdown

As you saw in Short Lab 1, we can run and execute R code within R Markdown. 
To do so encase your code as follows.


    `r ''````{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
    # Your code goes here!
    ```

You can click the green triangle in the corner to evaluate that code chunk to preview the results without compiling the entire document

---

## Useful Code Chunk Parameters

Parameters go into the opening brackets `{r}` and are separated by commas. Here are some you might find useful (checkout the guide links above for more):

* `echo=FALSE`: Hide R code but keep results

* `eval=FALSE`: Do not execute the R code

* `include=FALSE`: Hides all output (useful to load packages at the beginning of your document)

* `cache=TRUE`: Stores the results of the chunk, and only re-runs if the chunk is changed. Useful for files that take a while to compile

* `fig.height=5, fig.width=5`: modify the dimensions of any plots that are generated in the chunk (units are in inches)

---

## In-Line R Code

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
```

You can also include and execute R code directly in the text of your .Rmd!
For example, say we define a variable
```{r}
x <- 7
```
If I want to reference this variable in text, I can do so directly by writing using ticks and starting with r. So if I type:

    The variable I want to reference is `r inline_expr("x", "md")`.
what will appear is:

The variable I want to reference is `r x`.

---

## In-Line R Code

* This allows you to easily see where your values came from!
* This prevents any typos in translating coding results to text!
* This allows you to modify your analysis without needing to copy and paste updated results into your text!
