As usual, all code below should follow the style guidelines from the lecture slides.

## Part 1. Read in text data

For this short lab, we will be using Project Gutenbergâ€™s The Complete Works of William Shakespeare. 
Use the command `read_lines()` from the `readr` package to read the text available at
"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/100/100-0.txt".
Make sure to store the text as a variable. Use the `skip` argument to discard the first 23 lines of extra info.

**1a.** Print the first 5 lines.

**1b.** Print the total number of lines.

**1c.** Remove all empty lines, and save this object to a new variable. Use this variable without empty lines for the rest of this assignment. Print the total number of lines remaining after removing empty lines. 

(*Hint: to remove empty elements from a string vector x, you could use* `x <- x[x != ""]`)

## Part 2. String Manipulation

**2a.** Use `str_c()` to collapse the Shakespeare string vector into one large string. (Don't try to print it!)

**2b.** Use `str_count()` to find out the number of times Shakespeare uses the word "hello".


**2c.** Use `str_split()` to separate your string into words. How many words are in the complete works of William Shakespeare? 

(*Hint: you might get a list of length 1 from* `str_split()` *that you have to convert to a vector. You could do this by using something like* `x <- unlist(x)` *or* `x <- x[[1]]`)

## Part 3. Factors

**3a.** Use the code below to load the `movies` data, courtesy of `the-numbers.com`. Turn the `genre` and `mpaa_rating` variables into factors.

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
movies <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018/2018-10-23/movie_profit.csv")
```

**3b.** Create a new factor variable in the movies tibble, `audience`, that recodes movie ratings to read `"children"` for G movies, `"all_ages"` for PG movies, `"teens_and_adults"` for PG-13 movies, and `"adults_only"` for R movies.

## Part 4. Dates

*Note: `lubridate` is not part of the tidyverse, so you will need to install and load it separately.*

**4a.** Convert the `release_date` variable into a column of `Date` objects using an appropriate function.

**4b.** Create a new column for `year` that extracts the year of release for each movie.
